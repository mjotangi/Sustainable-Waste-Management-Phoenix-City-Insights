Insights:
- By analyzing the total tons collected at landfills & transfer stations in 2023, we can assess the operational efficiency of these waste processing facilities. Indentifying peak periods of waste collection can help in resource allocation and scheduling.
- Check the breakdown of waste types(recycle, refuse and green)to plan better recycling programs and eco-friendly projects.
- Track monthly waste collection to see if there are seasonal patterns. This helps in planning when waste generation might peak or dip.
- Find out how much waste comes from homes versus other places to target education and outreach efforts for better waste disposal.
